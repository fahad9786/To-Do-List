# To-Do-List
Swift To-Do List App

## Overview

This SwiftUI To-Do List app is built using Swift, SwiftUI, and integrates with Google Firebase as a backend. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their to-do items in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **User authentication:** Register and log in to the app securely.
- **Firebase integration:** Backend support for storing and retrieving to-do list items.
- **Beautiful UI:** Explore various SwiftUI constructs for creating a visually appealing user interface.
- **Data Persistence:** Save and retrieve to-do list items from a database.

## Design Process

I used Figma to design the initial layout of the app, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The design process involved creating wireframes and prototypes to finalize the app's look and feel.

## Firebase Integration

The app leverages Firebase services for backend support. Firebase Firestore is used as a real-time, cloud-hosted, NoSQL database to store and retrieve to-do list items. Firebase authentication ensures secure user logins and data access.

## Security Measures

User passwords are securely stored, and the authentication system allows users to select strong passwords. The app prioritizes user data security by implementing Firebase's authentication features.

## How to Run the App

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
